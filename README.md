The Simon Game is a classic memory game that challenges players to remember and replicate increasingly complex sequences of colors. The game starts with a single color lighting up, and with each round, the sequence grows by one more color. Players must repeat the sequence correctly to advance to the next level. The game ends when a player makes a mistake in the sequence.
